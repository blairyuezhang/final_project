<h2>Name: Where Does It Go?</h2>
<h2>Category: Story/Game</h2>
<h3>This is a educational for children to learn about sustainability and recycling. There will be different types of garbege illustration showing on the screen and three different trash cans which are Mixed Paper, Plastic and Metal and Landfilled. Children will first need to answer if they want to pick up the trash. If they do, game starts. When they sort all the garbege correctly, they will get a star. If they don't, there will be a sad Earth character coming out. Children can then choose if they want to pick up the garbege instead.
